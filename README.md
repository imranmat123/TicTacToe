TaciturnTicTacToe is a Java implementation leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, iterative loops, and conditional statements. Its architecture facilitates strategic gameplay, orchestrating 'X' and 'O' movements. Designed for simplicity, the codebase emphasizes logical structuring. TaciturnTicTacToe operates within a controlled environment where user decisions navigate through predefined pathways. The utilization of if statements ensures conditional logic, dictating game flow and outcomes. Players engage in a discrete state space, with each move triggering algorithmic responses. TaciturnTicTacToe encapsulates core Java functionality, embodying the essence of traditional TicTacToe while adhering to established programming paradigms.
